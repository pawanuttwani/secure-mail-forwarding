# Secure Email Forwarding

## Here are several compelling reasons to utilize this service:

1. Safeguard your primary email address from spam by easily deactivating or deleting aliases that attract unwanted emails.
2. Pinpoint the source of data sales by employing distinct email addresses for different websites.
3. Shield your identity in case of a data breach by complicating hackers' attempts to correlate your accounts.
4. Foil inbox prying by encrypting all incoming emails with GPG/OpenPGP encryption.
5. Modify email forwarding destinations without the hassle of updating your email address for each site separately.
6. Respond to forwarded emails anonymously, preserving the confidentiality of your actual email address.
